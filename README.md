# Qwiklabs
I started using Qwiklabs few months ago and started practicing with google cloud platform. In this repo i share you some tips, tricks and scripts to perform lab in a better and accurate way.

In this repo I am sharing you some main Quest Scripts and Cheat sheet so you can easily perform lab without any issue

I have also played Google Cloud Computing Foundations Speedrun 1. In this you have to complete lab very fast. So, I have prepared a cheat sheet and some script with the help of gcloud command line so you can perform the labs very quickly.

Soon we also try to use some better way to perform labs.
like using pre defined templates to faster, improved and bug free execution.
