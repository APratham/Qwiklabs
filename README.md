# Qwiklabs
I started using Qwiklabs few months ago and started practicing with google cloud platform. In this repo i share you some tips, tricks and scripts to perform lab in a better and accurate way.

In this repo I am sharing you some main Quest Scripts and Cheat sheet so you can easily perform lab without any issue

I have also played Google Cloud Computing Foundations Speedrun 1. In this you have to complete lab very fast. SO i have prepared a cheat sheet and some script with the help of gcloud command line so you can perform the labs very quickly.
