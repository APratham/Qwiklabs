    - This Lab Requires user 2 ID while Execution

- **2nd LAB : [Introduction to SQL for BigQuery and Cloud SQL](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/2802?parent=catalog)**
    - This lab is working fine. No need to add anything or change

- **3rd LAB : [Multiple VPC Networks](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/1230?parent=catalog)**
    - This lab is working fine. No need to add anything or change

- **4th LAB : [Cloud Monitoring: Qwik Start](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/10599?parent=catalog)**
    - **Google Cloud SDK doesnt allow to create Alerting & Uptime Check**
    - So you need to follow procedure to create Alerting & Uptime Check in cloud monitoring from Google Cloud Console manually after script execution.
